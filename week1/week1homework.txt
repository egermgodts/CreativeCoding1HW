Graphical user interface, GUI, uses a more visual approach to computer interaction. GUI uses physical icons to direct you around the interface and is very user-friendly because you don't have to have the prior knowledge of the commands to use Command Line Interface, CLI. CLI is text-based and requires the user to enter commands to navigate the system. CLI has more of a learning curve as you must remember the commands and how to use them. CLI also requires a keyboard most of the time to type out the commands, while GUI is more commonly just buttons on a screen so you can just use a mouse or a touchscreen. Some of the advantages of GUI include simplicity for beginners and available tasks are visually available. For experts, CLI is much quicker to use than GUI and it is especially helpful to do repetitive tasks quickly. Another thing that can impact a beginner's use of CLI is that syntax errors can lead the user to not get the desired result. CLI has more potential for more complex tasks with the right amount of knowledge.
