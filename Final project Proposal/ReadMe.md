I intend to make a sound baord of sorts. I want to add a picture and sound for each bird of the alphabet so when you click the key for that letter it makes the sound of that bird. I will have to learn how to add photos and sound into my p5.js documents and how to make them work. If I am being so honest I will be working on this in any free time I have as I am trying to complete mutiple bodies of work in all of my studio classes that are consuming my every waking hour. I want it to look cute my idea is almost that it acts as a codde so someone can type out for example their name but hehe now its all bird sounds. I didn't really have any specific inspiration form other artists I just had an idea the other night, I also just really love birds. All I have done for my final thus far has been making the files I will use, so I'm off to a great start.
